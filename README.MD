# ESP32 Project

This project involves the development of an electronic control lock system using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system includes features such as facial recognition, voice functionality, password unlocking, and a mobile app.

## Features

- **Electronic Control Lock**: Secure locking mechanism controlled by the ESP32.
- **Facial Recognition**: Unlock the system using facial recognition technology.
- **Voice Functionality**: Control the lock using voice commands.
- **Password Unlocking**: Unlock the system using a password.
- **Mobile App**: Control and monitor the lock system through a dedicated mobile application.

## Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The main controller for the system.
- **Camera Module**: For capturing images for facial recognition.
- **Microphone**: For capturing voice commands.
- **Keypad**: For entering passwords.
- **Mobile App**: For remote control and monitoring.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-project.git
    ```
